# Autoencoder-Reconstruction-of-Mixed-MNIST-and-CIFAR-10-Images
In this project, I will delve into autoencoders, a fundamental technique in deep
learning, to reconstruct images from two distinct datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10. The objective
is to create an autoencoder model capable of taking the mean of an MNIST and a CIFAR-10
image, feeding it into the model, and generating reconstructions of both MNIST and CIFAR-10
images.
